For this task I was provided two dataframes- “ipl17” & “1pl18” having the records of all the ipl teams that won the match, lost the match, net run rate of each team, etc. I had to answer two questions:

Question-1: Suppose in ‘ipl18’, you want to filter out the teams that have an NRR greater than zero, and for which the ‘For’ score exceeds the ‘Against’ score, i.e. both the conditions should be satisfied. Which teams will be left after you perform the above filtration?

Question-2: If all the stats are taken for both ‘ipl17’ and ‘ipl18’, which team with its total points greater than 25 will have the highest win percentage
